// Exercise: model an organization. Within an organization, employees are hired for one
//            specific role. In their role, they fulfill one or more functions. Model
//            the 'Employee' data structure to correctly represent these relations.
//           The employee type should have a member function 'print' that prints the
//            employee information including role and functions. The mappings of each
//            employee/role/function is given in 'main'.
